#Nyanpollo Player

Nyanpollo is a high altitude balloon launched by Pawel, Matt, Dan and Thai on October 24th, 2015. It captured video and sensor data. This is a JavaScript web page for replaying the sensor data and videos. You will currently need the mp4 video for it (1.2GB), though I will upload and switch to a copy on YouTube at some point.

Because of some technical issues, the video and sensors would reset after 13 seconds or so. This, this particular version has a bunch of code to adjust for the gaps. The next mission will go better, and those hacks will be removed (probably).
